# responsible-ai-lib-with-state-of-data-brazil-dataset

This repository will showcase an example of how to use the [Responsible AI library](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox) with [State of Data Brazil 2022's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datahackers/state-of-data-2022).

The dataset benefited from the expert review of Bain & Company, documented in their [insightful report](https://www.bain.com/contentassets/16494c60fcd045188615f05e728385b3/state-of-data2022_um-raio-x-dos-profissionais-de-dados-do-brasil.pdf), 
and the valuable feedback and analysis provided by a community of developers during its Kaggle competition.
